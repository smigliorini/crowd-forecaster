# Forecasting POI Occupation with Contextual Machine Learning

#### Structure of repository

In this repository, there are two folders: **data** and **src**.

There are two scripts in **src**: 

- train DNN.py for training a model using deep neural network 
- train RF.py for training a model using the random forest method.

In the **data** folder, there is the dataset divided by POI (Point of Interest). In particular, there are several files named *export_\*.csv*, where * represents the *id* of the considered POI. 

#### Customize

In both scripts, there is the possibility to customize the configuration of the code.

The path and name of the reference dataset used for training are specified in each script's `file_name` variable. You may choose whether to employ the "raw" dataset, e.g., data without context such as weather forecast and holiday, or the "raw+context" dataset by modifying the variable `train`. It is assigned to 'raw' by default.

In *train_DNN.py*, it is possible to edit:

- the number of nodes of the layers with `nodes`
- the number of epochs with `epochs`
- the percentage of dropout with `drop`.

In *train_RF.py*, changing `trees`, the random forest's number of trees is customized.

## Running scripts

#### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- pandas
- Tensorflow ==  2.7.0
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib (optional if graphs are to be displayed)

#### Run commands

After the repository has been cloned.

- Running the Deep Neural Network:

  ```bash
  cd src
  python train_DNN.py
  ```

- Running the Random Forest:

  ```bash
  cd src
